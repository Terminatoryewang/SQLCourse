-- if you want to print other columns then you'll need to use aggregate functions (covered in classes ahead)

-- ORDER BY
-- Sort all the movies alphabetically 
SELECT * from movies ORDER BY title;

-- LIMIT OFFSET
-- Print all the rows from id 6 to 10

-- Dealing with DATE datatype

-- LIKE 
-- think of it has SQL regex
-- _ -> one character
-- % -> 0/1/multiple characters
-- Find all the movies starting with T
SELECT * from movies where title LIKE 'T%';

-- Find only the movies which have a 'Toy Story' and then a digit after it
SELECT * from movies where title LIKE 'Toy Story _' OR title LIKE 'Toy Story';


-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
-- MIN and MAX -> Finds the minimum/ maximum of the column selected
-- SUM -> sums the values of the column 
-- COUNT -> counts the number of rows that satisfy the condition 
-- AVG -> average value of the column or selected columns is returned 

-- Find the movie with shortest duration
SELECT MIN(minutes), title from movies;

-- Find the latest movie released in the table
SELECT MAX(year), title from movies;

-- Find average length of all Toy Story movies
SELECT AVG(minutes) from movies where title LIKE 'Toy Story%';

-- Find the total duration of watching all the Toy Story movies in the table
SELECT SUM(minutes) from movies where title LIKE 'Toy Story%';

-- Find how many Toy story movies are there in the table
SELECT count(title) from movies where title LIKE 'Toy Story%';

-- How many movies have been directed by Dan Scanlon
SELECT count(title), director from movies where director = 'Dan Scanlon';

-- How many movies are more than 90 minutes in length


-- Query as expression 
-- +, -, /, *, ()
-- BODMAS rules apply
-- Want to see how many seconds long is each movie instead of minutes
SELECT title, director, minutes*60, year from movies;

-- AS (alias)
SELECT title, director, minutes*60 AS seconds, year from movies;

-- GROUP BY
-- Can't use it without an aggregate function
-- FInd how many movies a director has been a part of
SELECT COUNT(*), director from movies group by director;

-- HAVING 
-- Only used with group by, additional condition on the query
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_movies, director from movies group by director having Total_movies > 1;

-- GOOD PRACTICE 
-- Indent the code wherever keywords are use
-- Go to the next line before the keywords starts
