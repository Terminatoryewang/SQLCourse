# Week 3 - Joins and Basic Functions
Welcome to the Week 3 of Foundations of SQL Course Repository! This week will focus on how to create views from tables to be able to perform data analyst tasks. It will focus on creating views by gathering information from more than 2 tables using Joins and perform functions like finding average, counting, summation of rows, etc.

## Using online resources for running SQL Code
To practice coding in SQL, you can either use any online compiler you like or use the link https://sqliteonline.com/ to code SQL in class. You can create an account on this website to save the code we practice in class. 

Create a new database in SQLite using "+" sign on the top left bar.

If you have a SQL server and Workbench installed, you can even use that for practicing SQL code.

## Presentation for Week 3
All the content that will be covered in the second class is present in the pdf of slides, located in the same directory (Week_3)

## Summary
- Aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN and MAX can be used with queries to perform more analysis on the numerical values of the table
- Using of LIKE keyword can help you match a pattern in the string or numerical values of the table
- JOINS are of majorly 5 types, INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER/FULL and SELF JOIN to perform analysis on combined rows of 2 tables based on the related column
- There is a particular order of execution of keywords that needs to be followed for every query.
