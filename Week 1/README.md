# Week 1 Introduction to ER Diagrams/Models 
Welcome to the Week 1 of Foundations of SQL Course Repository! This week will focus on concepts of database and building an ER diagram from business requirements.

## Using online resources for building ER Model
To practice building an ER Model, you can either use any online compiler you like or use the link https://erdplus.com/ to build ER Models in class. To build ER diagrams you can use the link https://drawsql.app/diagrams in the class. You could also prefer to use a pen and paper to build the diagrams as they can be easily manipulated in the way you like.
