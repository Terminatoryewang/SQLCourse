# Week 2 - DDL Commands and Basic SQL Queries
Welcome to the Week 2 of Foundations of SQL Course Repository! This week will focus on how to create a database schema for a business. It will also focus on reading the data from database with some basic SQLECT SQL query.

## Using online resources for running SQL Code
To practice coding in SQL, you can either use any online compiler you like or use the link https://nextleap.app/online-compiler/sql-programming to code SQL in class. You can create an account on this website to save the code we practice in class. If you have a SQL server and Workbench installed, you can even use that for practicing SQL code.

## Presentation for Week 2
All the content that will be covered in the second class is present in the pdf of slides, located in the same directory (Week_2)
