# Week 4 - Intermediate SQL Concepts
Welcome to the Week 4 of Foundations of SQL Course Repository! This week will focus on how to create views from joining more than one table. It will also contain the concept of Subqueries, where you get write query inside another query. We will also learn how to update the structure of the table once they are created (remaining DDL queries).

## Using online resources for running SQL Code
To practice coding in SQL, you can either use any online compiler you like or use the link https://sqliteonline.com/ to code SQL in class. You can create an account on this website to save the code we practice in class. 

Create a new database in SQLite using "+" sign on the top left bar.

If you have a SQL server and Workbench installed, you can even use that for practicing SQL code.
